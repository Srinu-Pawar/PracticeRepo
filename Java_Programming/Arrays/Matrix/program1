Input Format

The first line of input contains N - the size of the matrix. It is followed by N lines each containing N integers - elements of the matrix.



Output Format

Print the sum of the lower triangle of the matrix.



Constraints

1 <= N <= 100

-105 <= ar[i] <= 105



Example

Input

3

5 9 -2

-3 4 1

2 6 1



Output

15
